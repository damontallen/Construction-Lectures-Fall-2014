    "First of all, from what you learned in your concrete class you should remember that concrete cures by growing microscopic crystals.  These crystals interlock forming a solid lattice in the shape of the form.  However, the form's surface is typically not really that smooth.  This means that during the formation of these crystals they will grow into the nooks and crannies of the plywood, or whatever material is used.  If the form is intended to remain in place permanently then this is a good thing, but if you are reusing forms then it is a problem.  \n",

    "When a wall is poured it typically does not just rest on the ground.  Walls are generally poured on top of smoothly finished slabs or spread footing.  The finishes of these horizontal surfaces are often too smooth to allow freshly poured concrete to form a good bond.  Without a good bond you will not have a water tight joint which can lead to all sorts of problems.  The way to prevent this problem is with the use of a bonding agent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bonding agent acts as a glue between the old and new concrete.  It is not only important to have it applied between walls and slabs, but it is also very important to use when walls are poured in sections to bond the next section to the previous one."

    "In all cases on concrete, unless it is a finished surface, use red chalk to mark your lines.  Do not use red chalk anywhere else, not on drywall, not on carpet, not anywhere but concrete.  Red chalk has a dye in it that makes it water proof.  This same dye will bleed through paint, and is almost impossible to get rid of.  This makes it perfect for concrete work where it is subject to be walked on or rained on.\n",

    "Secondly, if you have some stainless steel studs available you *can* drill them into the slab and use them as a stop to butt the prebuilt wall form up against.  There can be some difficulties with this technique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. While drilling the hole for the stud your workers might hit a hard piece of aggregate that causes the hole to be misaligned.\n",
    "2. Stainless steel is a little pricey and it takes time to drill the holes to place all the studs.\n",
    "3. If your workers use plain steel instead of stainless you will have spalling wherever these studs were placed.\n",

    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The upside of this technique is that once the studs are in place the placement of the forms can go more rapidly.  I am of the opinion that it may be faster and more accurate to use stainless steel clips nailed into place with a powdered actuated nail gun.  This would be a faster installation due to not having to drill and more accurate due to the reduced impact of hard aggregate on the placement of the clip.  Additionally, the workers would be much less likely to install plain steel since the clips would most likely be unique on the job site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, for a job built wall form it is common that the bottom plate of one side is not attached to the wall form prior to its placement.  Instead the bottom plate is fastened in place and then the rest of the wall form is attached to the bottom plate once it has been placed.  The advantage is that it is easy to align a single 2x4 and with multiple attachment points it is unlikely that a single piece of aggregate will cause a substantial shift in placement.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The difficult part is fastening the plywood of the form to the bottom plate through the rebar cage.  This only requires a simple tool that can be made on the job, a peashooter.  A job built peashooter consists of a metal pipe with a diameter no bigger than 1/2\" and a metal rod that is small enough to pass though the pipe (all thread can do).  Cut the pipe such that it is long enough to, while touching the surface of the wall form, extend beyond the rebar cage a little more than the width of a hand, about 6\".  Next cut the rod to be about 6\" longer than that.  Place a stop on the rod such that it sticks out on one end of the pipe and is flush with the other end.  Nails can be place in the pipe and then driven into place by hitting the rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the ties have been inserted in to the wall form the other side can be fastened to the ties, and then that side's bottom plate is fastened to the slab.  The ties provide alignment positioning of the other side in all cases."

By attaching a scrap piece of wood to the top of the wall form such that the end is a known distance from the outside face of the plywood.  This allows one worker to measure the distance from the outside face of the plywood to the plumb line or the tip of the plumb-bob, while a second worker shifts the top of the wall into alignment.  Once the wall is aligned then the brace is nailed into place and the process is repeated at the far end of the wall.  With both ends plumbed an offset string-line can be stretched between the ends.  At this point the remaining braces are attached one-by-one after aligning the rest of the wall form with the aid of the string.\n",
