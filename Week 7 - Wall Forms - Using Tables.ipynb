    "As an alternative to a strictly analytically approach, there are tables in the Formwork text that you can use.  These tables however, are limited to a smaller selection of material.  For instance, instead of plywood you will have to design using Class I Plyform if you use Table 7-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 7-2 has values for 1/2\" to 1\", wet, Class I Plyform, with both $C_D = 1.0$ and $C_D = 1.25$, in either the strong, or weak orientation.  This is the only material used, in the Formwork text tables of pre-calculated span limits for sheathing.  There are other sheathing tables but they are for other support conditions, and we are only interested in sheathing supported over three or more spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables 7-5, 7-6, and 7-7 are similar to the sheathing tables except for beams.  They are for different support conditions, and both duration factors.  There are more sizes than for the sheathing though, eight instead of four, or sixteen instead of four if you count the flat use orientations.  These beam tables are arranged such that the .1 version contains values found using $C_D = 1.0$, and the .2 version contains values using $C_D= 1.25$.  Both the .1 and .2 versions are for No.2 Douglas Fir-Larch lumber.  For example Table 7-5.2 contain pre-calculated span limits for No.2, Douglas Fir-Larch lumber, supported over three or more spans with a 1.25 load duration factor.  There are .3 and .4 versions of these tables as well.  They are just the same as the .1 and .2 versions, except that those values are found using No.1/No.2 grade Spruce Pine Fir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables 7-8 through 7-10 are for double wales.  In this case the .1 version uses No.2 Douglas Fir-Larch, and the .2 version uses Spruce Pine Fir.  Each individual table is broken up into a left and right side for, $C_D = 1.0$, and $C_D = 1.25$ respectively.  Each of these sub-tables contains span limits for nine different double wale sizes, ranging form double 2x4s to double 4x8s.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't done any shoring calculations yet, but Table 7-11 contains allowable axial loads of a variety of species, sizes, and effective lengths.  However, the values in this table are all found using a $C_D=1.0$.  This is not unreasonable since you are much more likely to reuse shores which means their capacity would have to be calculated using a $C_D=1.0$ anyway.  I do have a couple words of caution about using these values in the future.  First, there are six obvious typos in the table.  Second, these values correspond to an older version of the Timber code, and as such they don't exactly match up with the Florida Building Code.  I will say that these values are close, but they are not exact; some will be smaller and some will be larger than the actual allowed values.  We will talk more about Table 7-11 in the slab form modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not be spending any time beyond now talking about the allowable bearing values found in Table 7-12.  I think you can figure it out by yourself, and I actually think it would be quicker calculating the values form the Timber code than using this Table.  Either way, be aware that you are responsible for using the correct (or newer) version of the building code. \n",

Nor will you see where the $C_D$ is written in any of the tables.  That is because it isn't.  The species and $C_D$ values I've given you are based on matching the properties listed to species in the Timber Supplement, and calculating support spacing limits using various adjustment factors.  In other words, I determined this information through a trial and error.  This is another reason why I like the Timber building codes, good documentation.\n",

If the table is divided based on load duration factor, then just remember that the higher allowable stress indicated in the table corresponds to a $C_D=1.25$."

This means,we are using the left hand side of Table 9.2.  The concrete pressure is pretty close to the $1,000 psf$ in the left hand column, but it is over.  This illiterates the first problem with using these tables, there are not exact values listed for every case.  However, as a rule of thumb (taken with a gain of salt...), if the value is within 5% of a lower pressure, you can use that pressure.  This means that you can use the values at $1,000 psf$ in this class; in your professional life, I recommend using the spreadsheets you write in this class.\n",

Or in other words read down to $1,000 psf$ in the first column and then read over to the first $3/4\"$ column, to find the allowable spacing of $10\"$.  Officially, for all tests and real projects you should read down to $1,100 psf$ and find the allowable spacing of $10\"$, which is the same in this case.\n",

    "You'll notice that the spacings are very different than what we found with the analytical approach.  This is mainly due to the fact that we sprung for the more expensive Plyform rather than just use $3/4\"$ plywood.  There are fewer calculations, but we are locked into using more expensive material.  Additionally, if we use a spreadsheet solution, we would be able to use the material we wanted, and have an exact solution.  Once the spreadsheet is set up correctly the first time, it will be easier to use than these tables.\n",

The reason is that this material will show up on the [AIC exam](http://www.professionalconstructor.org/?page=AC_Certification), and you might end up going to work for someone that believes this is the fastest way to work.  Either way, you need to be able to use these tables."
