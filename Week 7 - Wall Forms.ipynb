      "By this point in your education you should be aware that concrete does not dry, but rather it cures.  This curing occurs at a specific rate based on the chemistry of the concrete, and the temperature at which it is cast.  Because, concrete starts as a liquid but then cures over time, it is possible that if you pour for long enough, or slow enough, then at some time, the first concrete you poured will have solidified.  This has an effect on the amount of force necessary to contain the concrete in the form work.  Specifically ACI has put out empirical equations, for wall forms, that are allowed to be used to find this lower pressure.\n",

      "\n",
      "* [APA's Design/Construction Guide: Concrete Forming](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/V345.pdf)\n",
      "* [Panel Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/D510.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "and you **will** need to download the file below since we **will** be using values from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [Plywood Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/Y510.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, we will be using Table 1 (Effective Section Properties for Plywood) and Table 3 (Allowable Stresses for Plywood).  \n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder why the Plywood Design Specifications is more important than the Design/Construction Guide: Concrete Forming.  Even though the Design/Construction Guide: Concrete Forming is specifically about formwork, it mainly has information on Plyform, and many forms are not built using Plyform.  Sanded plywood is more commonly used in concrete form work than Plyform.  Thus the properties found in the Plywood Design Specifications are typically more important than the values in the Design/Construction Guide: Concrete Forming.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously plywood and Plyform are not the only forming material used in form work.  Steel is also a common form material, but if you are using steel forms, then they will have been prefabricated, and it is unlikely that you were involved in the design process.  For this reason, we will be studying designing forms using plywood.  One of the reasons it is so common, is that plywood is relatively inexpensive, versicle, and readily available.  Because of this, almost every structure of any size has had plywood forms used, at some stage, in its construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We *will* use Plyform for *some* formwork designs.  The properties of Plyform can be found in [APA's Design/Construction Guide: Concrete Forming](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/V345.pdf), specifically in Table 12 (Section Properties for Plyform Class I and Class II, and Structural I Plyform) and Table 13 (Allowable Stresses).  However, in this class, we will most likely be using the pre-calculated values in Table 7-2 in our Formwork for Concrete text.\n",
      "\n",
      "While reading you may notice that the [Plywood Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/Y510.pdf) I'm having you download was published in 1998, while the [Panel Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/D510.pdf) was published in 2012.  Both of these files contain the same information, but it is arranged in them in very different formats.  For our purposes the [Plywood Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/Y510.pdf) is arranged in the most compact fashion.  It will be easier to use the two tables in the 1998 publication than the six tables on the 2012 publication.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, the 2012 publication does have some clear writing describing the properties of plywood so I would encourage you to download the [Panel Design Specification](http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/D510.pdf), and read sections 1.1 Plywood, 2.2.2 Grades, 2.3.3 Sanded, 4.1 Strength axis, and 4.4.4 Shear in the plane of the panel.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, when looking up any values for plywood, keep in mind that you should always use the **sanded plywood** values.  When non-sanded plywood is used in concrete form work, it will adhere to the concrete, and both be damaged, and damage the concrete during its removal."

      "The reason I didn't use 14 is that you cannot find 6.8571\" on any tape measure.  You need to remember that this form is gonig to be built by construction workers, and they will need to be able to not only easily find the spacing you pick on their tape measures, but also all the multiples of that spacing.  Those values that can easily be found for an 8 ft sheet of plywood are, 3\", 4\", 6\", 8\", 12\" (1 ft), 16\", 19.2\", 24\" (2 ft), 32\", and 48\" (4 ft).  Why is 19.2\" on the list?  In the picture of the tape measure you'll see a black diamond at 19.2\".  This corresponds to 96\"/5.  There are special indicators for every 16\" and 1 ft increment too.  A complete list of usable spacings can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pyzxpv0aipadbri/Allowable%20Spacings.pdf)."
