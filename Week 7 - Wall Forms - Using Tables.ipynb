      "Table 7-2 has values for 1/2\" to 1\", wet, Class I Plyform, with both $C_D = 1.0$ and $C_D = 1.25$, in either the strong, or weak orientation.  This is the only material used, in the Formwork text tables of pre-calculated span limits for sheathing.  There are other sheathing tables but they are for other support conditions, and we are only interested in sheathing supported over three or more spans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tables 7-5, 7-6, and 7-7 are similar to the sheathing tables except for beams.  They are for different support conditions, and both duration factors.  There are more sizes than for the sheathing though, eight instead of four, or sixteen instead of four if you count the flat use orientations.  These beam tables are arranged such that the .1 version contains values found using $C_D = 1.0$, and the .2 version contains values using $C_D= 1.25$.  Both the .1 and .2 versions are for No.2 Douglas Fir-Larch lumber.  For example Table 7-5.2 contain pre-calculated span limits for No.2, Douglas Fir-Larch lumber, supported over three or more spans with a 1.25 load duration factor.  There are .3 and .4 versions of these tables as well.  They are just the same as the .1 and .2 versions, except that those values are found using No.1/No.2 grade Spruce Pine Fir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tables 7-8 through 7-10 are for double wales.  In this case the .1 version uses No.2 Douglas Fir-Larch, and the .2 version uses Spruce Pine Fir.  Each individual table is broken up into a left and right side for, $C_D = 1.0$, and $C_D = 1.25$ respectively.  Each of these sub-tables contains span limits for nine different double wale sizes, ranging form double 2x4s to double 4x8s.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven't done any shoring calculations yet, but Table 7-11 contains allowable axial loads of a variety of species, sizes, and effective lengths.  However, the values in this table are all found using a $C_D=1.0$.  This is not unreasonable since you are much more likely to reuse shores which means their capacity would have to be calculated using a $C_D=1.0$ anyway.  I do have a couple words of caution about using these values in the future.  First, there are six obvious typos in the table.  Second, these values correspond to an older version of the Timber code, and as such they don't exactly match up with the Florida Building Code.  I will say that these values are close, but they are not exact; some will be smaller and some will be larger than the actual allowed values.  We will talk more about Table 7-11 in the slab form modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not be spending any time beyond now talking about the allowable bearing values found in Table 7-12.  I think you can figure it out by yourself, and I actually think it would be quicker calculating the values form the Timber code than using this Table.  Either way, be aware that you are responsible for using the correct (or newer) version of the building code. \n",

Nor will you see where the $C_D$ is written in any of the tables.  That is because it isn't.  The species and $C_D$ values I've given you are based on matching the properties listed to species in the Timber Supplement, and calculating support spacing limits using various adjustment factors.  In other words, I determined this information through a trial and error.  This is another reason why I like the Timber building codes, good documentation.\n",
