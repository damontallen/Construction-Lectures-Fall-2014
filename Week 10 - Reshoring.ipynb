When we add a new slab, we must distribute 1 slab dead load through the supports.  This is a little unusual in this method since the slabs cannot move to react, so no loads can be carried by the slabs.  Next, we get to the shore loads.  At level 2, there is one slab above, and it is not carrying any load so the shore must carry 1 slab dead load.  At level 1, there are two slabs above those shores, but neither slab is carrying any load, the shores must carry 2 slab dead loads.

    "What I am showing here, is the table from the previous slide.  From here on out, the results from, adding slabs, removing shores, and reshores, will just follow the same processes as we've already seen.  To be clear, this example is more for teaching you how to calculate these ending loads, than an appropriate reshoring sequence.  The sequence *you* will have to follow, will depend on how much time you need to keep the slab forms in place, and how much time you have your schedule for each pour.  As a general rule of thumb, the more levels of slabs that are poured before stripping, the greater the strength of the the formwork needs to be.  This is especially true for the shores.  Another idea you should take away from this, is that the more levels of reshores you have in place, the more slabs will be carrying the load from a fresh pour, and the less likely any particular slab will fail.\n",

    "As you proceed down, from one action to the next, you should get to a point where you repeatedly get the right results.  Once you are confident that you can calculate the loads, resulting from a specific action, given the current condition of the building, then continue to the right.\n",
