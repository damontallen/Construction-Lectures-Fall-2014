The main tip for having a good audoi recording (low background noise) is to turn 
the volume of the microphone down and move it very close to your mouth.  The 
procedure to use to determine the correct volume of the microphone is to place 
it an inch away from your mouth and then adjust its volume while recording in
Audacity.  When you are not speaking the ine should be flat.  When you do speeak 
it shold peak out at 3/4 max.  This should let you create audio file with 
practically no background noise and better quality that the original recordings.
