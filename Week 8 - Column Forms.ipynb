      "Column forms start out similar to wall forms.  Both require you to calculate the concrete pressure, and you need to analyze the plywood to determine the support spacing.  You will even have to look at the support spacing for the studs, except that the studs are likely to be placed on the flat.  This change is not difficult to take into account you would just need to apply the $C_{fu}$ factor to the allowable bending stress, and use the properties in Table 1B that are for bending about the Y-Y Axis.\n",

The important part of this is that we will be using the [Clamp Spacing Chart (pdf)](http://www.masco.net/pdf/catalogs/formingandaccessories/page83.pdf).  The way this spacing chart is used is on the left you read off the pressure in the form, and you read over to the size of the column form to detemine the clamp spacing at that point. ([www.masco.net](http://www.masco.net/))\n",
      "\n",
      "The way this chart, and others like it, are setup is that the concrete pressure is based on the hydrostatic pressure of liquid concrete at the depth indicated (distance from the top).  Even though the pressure equations, mentioned in the wall form presentation, are still valid, the column will more likely be filled at such a rate as the hydrostatic pressure will control anyway.  The result of all of this is that you can simply find your column size, and just read from the top down to get all the clamp spacings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, if your column form is 24\" by 24\", and 10' tall, then, starting from the top, you would have a clamp at 2\" down, then the next one is 28\" below that then, 24\", 20\", 18\", 12\", and 12\".  This last clamp ends up about 4\" above the base.  You will always want a clamp somewhere between 4\" to 6\" above the base, so if the column was 10'-6\" tall then an additional clamp would need to be added.  This reduces the load on the fasteners in the wooden base plate (or yoke) around the bottom."

Beyond a certain size, you will need to resort to ties, or [pencil rod](http://williamsform.com/Concrete_Forming_Hardware/Test_Area/Miscellaneous_Light_Concrete_Forming/form_clamp2.jpg) and [pencil rod clamps](http://williamsform.com/Concrete_Forming_Hardware/Test_Area/Miscellaneous_Light_Concrete_Forming/form_clamp1.jpg), in conjunction with wales to resist the spread of a form (aka a blowout).\n",

It doesn't take much to hold a form down, but once it starts to go, more surface area becomes exposed to the upward pressure at the bottom of the form, and failure becomes inevitable.  The best thing to do to prevent it is to have a tight fit between the base  of the form and the slab, or footing.  Think of it like this, it is easy to stop a small leak, but it is hard to stop a large one.  The force required to stop either is,\n",
