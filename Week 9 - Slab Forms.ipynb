    "The design procedure is similar to wall forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the load on the plywood.\n",
    "2. Determine the support spacing for the plywood, (joists are used for support instead of studs in this case).\n",
    "3. Determine the support spacing for the joists, (stringers are used for support instead of wales).\n",
    "4. Determine the support spacing for the stringers, (shores instead of ties).\n",
    "5. Determine the bearing strength (one additional case in slab forms).\n",
    "    1. Bearing between joists and stringers.\n",
    "    2. Bearing between stringers and shores.\n",
    "6. Determine the capacity of the shore, (we will use timber columns for our shores).\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the fact that there is one additional bearing check we need to make, there is one other difference.  That difference is the constructible spacings.  When we were looking are wall forms everything we looked at was based around getting the spacings to work out with the size of a sheet of plywood.  We only need to design around a sheet of plywood when we are doing the plywood support spacings in slab forms, i.e. the joist spacings.  Our joists are not limited to $48\"$ and $96\"$, instead joists will generally be a standard lumber length.  Lumber is typically sold in either $8'$, $10'$, $12'$, $14'$, or $16'$ lengths.  This variety means that we will have to decide how long we want the joists to be when we determine their support spacings.  For instance if we find that the joists should be supported every $42\"$, then instead of rounding down to $32\"$ to use an $8'$ long member ($3 \\times 32\" = 96\" = 8'$) we will just use $14'$ long joists ($4 \\times 42\" = 168\" = 14'$).  I'll cover an analytically approach of determining this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start working on an example problem, I should mention a couple of assumptions I will be making in all slab design problems.  Firstly, all joists will be 4x4s.  This isn't required in a professional setting, but they are used commonly enough that it isn't an unreasonable assumption.  Secondly, all stingers will be 4x6s (oriented in the strong direction).  Again, it isn't really required but it is relatively common.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that 4x4s and 4x6s are *so* common that I can make these assumptions, is that the use such stout members eliminates the need for labor intensive, intermediate blocking.  Such blocking *would* be needed to prevent rollover for taller and thinner members.   Let's go ahead, and work through an example problem."
