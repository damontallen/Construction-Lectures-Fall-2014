      "Typically trench excavation is supported by trench boxes (aka trench shields) now days.  This is for conveyance and usability.  However, OSHA's specification on Excavations in [1926 Subpart P - Excavations](https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10930) include a section on [Timber Shoring in subpart P appendix C](https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10933), along with the tables to design them.  OSHA's version of the tables are pretty rough, so I've cleaned them up, and more readable versions can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gi5x1oyv1ojm4ld/wCkXqLpo4x/Timber%20Tables%20with%20notes.pdf).  The reason to get familiar with these tables, is that they are really the most difficult excavation shoring tables out there.  That being said, if you can use one of these tables, then the much simpler tables for trench boxes will be a piece of cake to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, designing shoring systems is only one aspect of trench safety, but that is something that you should have already covered in your safety class so I am not going to cover it here.  If you have not had a safety class on trenches, then you can either simply read the [OSHA specifications](https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10930), or take one of the many classes on trench safety offered privately by manufactures and rental companies.  Depending on your situation, you might even get to take one for free.\n",

      "Firstly, this table is formatted slightly different to the ones in my [pdf here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gi5x1oyv1ojm4ld/wCkXqLpo4x/Timber%20Tables%20with%20notes.pdf), but it contains the same information, and we use it the same way.  First we read down to our tench depth, i.e. 13 ft would fall in the \"10 TO 15\" range.  Next we pick our Horizontal spacing of our cross braces.  Let's have our cross braces spaced at 8 ft on center.  Let's also say that our trench is 6 ft wide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With this final bit of information we can determine the member sizes, and remaining spacings.  Our cross braces need to be 4x6s and spaced vertically every 4 ft.  Our wales need to be 6x8s also spaced 4 ft vertically.  Lastly, our uprights need to be 4x6s, but since this is Type A soil we only need to have one ever 4 ft horizontally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we have covered timber beams and columns you might be strick by the sizes of the members.  The reason for this is when soil fails, and the trench tries to collapse, that soil will act like a liquid that weights 120 pounds per cubic foot.  You can think of soil like concrete except that it sets up instantly when it stops moving.  In a shallow 5 ft trench, the soil pressure could be as much as 600 psf.  That would be like a car parked on your chest, almost certain death."
